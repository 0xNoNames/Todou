## TODO

- [ ] Setup CLAP
- [ ] Don't show task already completed
- [ ] Add metadata to tasks
- [ ] Find `TODO.md` in current git project (checkout how `just` works), maybe only with -p option
- [ ] Create a `~/.todou` as a git project with tasks
- [ ] Automatic commit/push/pull, if error on merge ask user to fix (maybe automatically open merge conflict?)
- [ ] TUI if `-i`?
- [ ] Parse markdown
- [ ] Add sub tasks?
- [ ] Category task in global task list
- [ ] Find `TODO:` in code for projects?
- [ ] `-` means doing task, `x` means done
- [ ] `-r` with no arguments uses FZF to display task to delete
- [ ] `-f` with no arguments uses FZF to display task to delete
- [ ] TODO in cyan/blue, DOING in yellow, DONE in green
